When planning infolist entries (for View pages), include enough detail that the
implementing agent can write them without looking anything up.

## Cover Every Model Property

**An infolist MUST specify an entry for every property on the model.** A View
page is the record's full detail view—unlike a form (only what's editable) or a
table (only what's scannable), it has no reason to hide data. The implementing
agent will build exactly the entries you list, so an incomplete plan produces an
incomplete View page.

Before writing the `Infolist:` section, enumerate the model's attributes:

```bash
php artisan model:show Order
```

That output—every column with its type and cast, plus the relationships—is the
checklist your plan must satisfy. Also account for `casts()`, `$appends`, and
`Attribute` accessors: they are real properties with no column behind them.

Your plan must include an entry for:

- Every database column—including `id`, foreign keys, nullable columns,
  `created_at`/`updated_at`, and `deleted_at` when the model soft-deletes
- Every appended/computed attribute (`$appends`, accessors)
- Every relationship—dotted path `TextEntry` for belongs-to
  (`Entry: customer.name`), `RepeatableEntry` for a small has-many

Omit an entry only for a stated reason—a hashed password, an API token or
secret, or a raw foreign key whose related label you already show. Write the
reason in the plan so the implementing agent doesn't "helpfully" add it back:

```
Omitted (deliberate):
  password_hash — never displayed
  api_token — secret
  customer_id — shown as customer.name instead
```

**Length is a layout problem, not a reason to drop properties.** If the panel is
long, group entries into Sections and collapse the low-interest ones (see
[schema-layouts.md]); a `Section: Record` with `Collapsed: yes` holding `id`
and the timestamps keeps the page tidy without losing data.

## Namespace Pattern

All infolist components: `Filament\Infolists\Components\{Component}`

## Entry Reference

| Data Type   | Component         | Docs URL                                                    |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| string/text | `TextEntry`       | https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/infolists/text-entry       |
| boolean     | `IconEntry`       | https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/infolists/icon-entry       |
| image       | `ImageEntry`      | https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/infolists/image-entry      |
| color       | `ColorEntry`      | https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/infolists/color-entry      |
| code        | `CodeEntry`       | https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/infolists/code-entry       |
| key-value   | `KeyValueEntry`   | https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/infolists/key-value-entry  |
| hasMany     | `RepeatableEntry` | https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/infolists/repeatable-entry |
| custom view | `ViewEntry`       | https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/infolists/custom-entries   |

Note: Dates, money, badges all use `TextEntry` with config methods.

**Enum entries**: Same as tables—enum can implement `HasLabel` (required),
`HasColor` and `HasIcon` (optional) from `Filament\Support\Contracts` for
automatic badge styling.

## Plan Format

```
Entry: status
  Component: Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry
  Docs: https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/infolists/text-entry
  Config: ->badge(), ->color(fn (string $state): string => match($state) { 'pending' => 'warning', 'confirmed' => 'success', default => 'gray' })

Entry: created_at
  Component: Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry
  Docs: https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/infolists/text-entry
  Config: ->dateTime()

Entry: is_active
  Component: Filament\Infolists\Components\IconEntry
  Docs: https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/infolists/icon-entry
  Config: ->boolean()
```

## Layout

See [schema-layouts.md] for complete layout component specifications including
Section, Tabs, Grid, Split, and configuration options.

Layout components use namespace: `Filament\Schemas\Components\{Component}`

### Column Configuration

Infolists default to 2 columns. **If you want single-column layout, you MUST
specify `Columns: 1` in your plan.** The implementing agent will use
`$schema->columns(1)`.

```
Infolist:
  Columns: 1

  Section: Customer Details
    ColumnSpan: full
    Entries:
      Entry: name ...
      Entry: email ...
```

### Nested Column Width

**Critical**: Column settings multiply through nesting. Calculate effective
entry width before specifying columns.

| Infolist Columns | Section Columns | Effective Entry Width | Result     |
| ---------------- | --------------- | --------------------- | ---------- |
| 2                | 1 (default)     | 50%                   | OK         |
| 2                | 2               | 25%                   | Too narrow |
| 1                | 2               | 50%                   | OK         |
| 1                | 1               | 100%                  | Full width |

**Rule**: If your infolist has 2 columns, sections should NOT also specify 2
columns—entries become too narrow (25% width). Either:

- Use `Infolist Columns: 1` with `Section Columns: 2`
- Use `Infolist Columns: 2` with sections at default (no columns specified)
- Use `ColumnSpan: full` on sections to break out of the parent grid

## Don't Write

| Bad (vague)           | Good (specific)                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| "Show the status"     | See plan format above           |
| "Show the key fields" | One `Entry:` per model property |
| "Display as a badge"  | `Config: ->badge()`             |
| "Format as date"      | `Config: ->dateTime()`          |
